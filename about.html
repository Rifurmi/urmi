My father is a respectable businessman & mother is a High School teacher.I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.We are two brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my brothers.Gardening and reading book is my most favourite pass time.Cooking and singing are also my passion.</blockquote>
